# SQL-Employee-Tracker

## Assignment Goal

The goal of this assignment was to create a command-line application that allowed a user to 

1) Add departments, roles, employees, 
2) View departments, roles, employees
3) Update employee roles

within an emloyee tracker database.

## Functionality

The application operates out of the command terminal using node and connects with mysql workbench to view and add changes to the tables.

## Thoughts:

I want to come back to this application and add bonus features.  The application runs and displays base features.
